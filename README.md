### 3. Why Docker & Containers?

Why would we want independent, standardized "application package"? \

- We want to have the **exact same environment for development and production** \
  -> This ensures that it works exactly as tested
- It should be easy to **share a common development environment**/ setup with (new) employees and colleagues
- We **don't want to uninstall and re-install** local dependencies and runtimes all the time

Install Docker Extension on VS Code
